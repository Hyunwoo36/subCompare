The app is easy to navigate and order with, and there's a search bar over each restaurant's menu if you're searching for something in particular. There's also a helpful 'Orders' tab at the bottom of your screen that shows you your past orders.

The app says it partners with over 365,000 restaurants. Delivery and service fees for our order to a suburban area totalled $6.99. Grubhub's estimated delivery window was between 35 and 45 minutes -- only a few minutes longer than Uber Eats/Postmates. When using this app in an urban area, our service fees were between $5.39 and $6.99, and our estimated delivery time was between 25 to 35 minutes for a restaurant 15 minutes away and 35 to 45 minutes for a restaurant 25 minutes away. Grubhub's service fees for delivery to an urban location are noticeably higher than service fees for the same order on Uber Eats/Postmates. Overall, Grubhub makes it easy to find deals on orders to help save you money. You might have to wait a few minutes longer for your delivery in suburban areas, though.",

            details: "Toast Takeout can help you support the local restaurants you know and love. Food delivery services usually charge commission fees that some restaurant owners have said hurt their businesses. Toast Takeout, however, doesn't charge these commission fees. That means if you order food from a local restaurant featured on the app, more of your money goes towards supporting the restaurant.",
